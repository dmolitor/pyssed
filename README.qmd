# pyssed <a href='https://www.dmolitor.com/'><img src='docs/pyssed.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

The goal of pyssed is to implement the Mixture Adaptive Design (MAD), as
proposed by [Liang and Bojinov](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05794).
MAD is an experimental design for multi-armed bandit algorithms that
enables anytime-valid inference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).
