The goal of pyssed is to provide methods for anytime-valid inference on the average treatment effect (ATE)
in adaptive experiments. pyssed implements the Mixture Adaptive Design (MAD) ([Liang and Bojinov, 2024][1]) which provides asymptotic confidence sequences for the ATE in arbitrary adaptive experimental designs and extensions to MAD ([Molitor and Gold, 2025][2]) which implement covariate-adjusted ATE estimation and dynamic sample balancing to improve precision and statistical power

pyssed implements methods for anytime-valid inference on average treatment effects (ATEs) in adaptive experiments. It implements the Mixture Adaptive Design (MAD) ([Liang and Bojinov, 2024](#ref1)), which delivers asymptotic confidence sequences for ATEs under arbitrary adaptive designs, along with extensions ([Molitor and Gold, 2025](#ref2)) that add covariate-adjusted estimation and dynamic sample balancing to enhance precision and statistical power.

## Installation

pyssed can be installed from PyPI with:

``` python
pip install pyssed
```

or from GitHub with:

``` python
pip install git+https://github.com/dmolitor/pyssed
```

## Example

We’ll simulate a simple binary experiment ($w \in \{0, 1\}$) using Thompson Sampling (TS)
as the bandit algorithm. We’ll demonstrate how covariate-adjusted MAD enables precise,
unbiased ATE estimation.
